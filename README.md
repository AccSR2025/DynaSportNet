# Sports Big Data and Cloud Computing for Athlete Health Monitoring

## Project Overview

This project explores the application of sports big data and cloud computing technologies in monitoring and managing athlete physical fitness and health. We propose a framework called **DynaSportNet**, which is a dynamic-aware, multimodal deep learning architecture designed to enable real-time and scalable health monitoring.

## Core Contributions

- DynaSportNet: A multimodal learning framework that integrates visual, kinematic, and auditory signals.
- PlayContextualizer: A strategy engine for domain-specific, context-informed decoding that enhances interpretability and coherence.
- Cross-modal fusion: Combines attention-guided modeling, hierarchical decoding, and agent-level reasoning for high-quality inference.
- Cloud-native deployment: Designed for intelligent and scalable athlete monitoring in real-world scenarios.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Multimodal sports signals including video, motion, and sound are collected during physical activity.
2. **Signal Alignment**: Inputs are processed with recurrent-convolutional networks and attention mechanisms.
3. **Contextual Decoding**: The PlayContextualizer models task-specific decoding pathways to enhance prediction.
4. **Traceability and Interpretability**: Ensures semantic alignment and reasoning transparency through structured decoding and action-aware refinement.

## Features

- Fine-grained spatiotemporal modeling of athlete signals
- Support for variable sampling rates and sequence lengths
- Real-time inference capabilities for health monitoring
- Designed with human-centric decision modeling principles

## Future Work

- Extend the framework to additional sports and movement types
- Integrate wearable sensor streams for enhanced input coverage
- Explore real-time deployment on edge or mobile devices
